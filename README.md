I have a idea, if I buy stocks while K or D is small than 20 and volume is incresed today, and sell it when K or D is greater than 80 and it's volume is decreased today.

  What is the profit of this stratage.
  
 # Result
 
 2303.TW has increased from 12 to 62 in 4 years, if I had followed my stratage I only have 120% rate of return.
 
   2303.TW has increased from 48 to 62 in a year, if I had followed my stratage I could have 89% rate of return.
